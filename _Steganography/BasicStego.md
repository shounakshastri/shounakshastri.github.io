## Introduction

Steganography is used to <span style='color:green'>_hide_</span> data in some other data. Now, in order to understand Steganography, it is important to understand why we hide stuff? Well, mostly because we want the said stuff to be safe from others as people might take it or tamper it or even worse, tell everybody else about it. Now, we can hide stacks of cash in a mattress or a can of paint, but what if your stuff is not a stack of cash? What if your stuff is more...incorporeal?

...

*No I am not talking about your feelings!*

Digital stuff! I am taling about digital data! 

What if your stuff is _digital_? Hiding your data or files by creating a bunch of folders in a flash drive kept in your drawer might seem easy, but if someone gets the flash drive, a simple search query would give the location of the data. We need something more sophisticated than this.

Enter Steganography.

Steganography hides digital data in other files. This makes it way more difficult to find hidden data. This can be used to hide secret military information like serveillance data in, or medical records, legal details, the possibilities are ever increasing.

## Cover and stego files

By now, it should be clear that Steganography needs two files.

1. the file containing the secret data
2. the file in which we would be hiding the secret data - *Cover file/data*

The file which contains the hidden secret data is called the *Stego file*

Mathematically speaking, if 

In N-dimensional simplex noise, the squared kernel summation radius $r^2$ is $\frac 1 2$
for all values of N. This is because the edge length of the N-simplex $s = \sqrt {\frac {N} {N + 1}}$
divides out of the N-simplex height $h = s \sqrt {\frac {N + 1} {2N}}$.
The kerel summation radius $r$ is equal to the N-simplex height $h$.

$$ r = h = \sqrt{\frac {1} {2}} = \sqrt{\frac {N} {N+1}} \sqrt{\frac {N+1} {2N}} $$
