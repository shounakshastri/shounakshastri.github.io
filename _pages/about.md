About Me
===
Hello, I am Shounak. I am a Researcher with a PhD in Steganography Algorithms from VIT, Vellore. I am an engineer interested in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Data Science.

During my PhD, I analysed legacy and state-of-the-art steganography algorithms, specifically Reversible Data Hiding (RDH) schemes and devised 2 novel techniques to hide secret data in image files.

I also served as a Teaching/Research Assistant for 4 years where I assisted several professors and students with their coursework and projects. The details of my responsibilities during this period can be found [here](https://shounakshastri.github.io/teaching/).

You can read about some of my work in my blogs about [steganography](https://shounakshastri.github.io/Steganography/) or check out my [published articles](https://shounakshastri.github.io/publications/) in scientific journals and conferences. For a complete list of my publications, you can visit my [ORCID page](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2247-9046).

I like to read fantasy novels, photograph landscapes and learn something new during my free time. At the time of writing this, I am learning to program in Java.
