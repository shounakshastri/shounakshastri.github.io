About Me
===

I am a PhD Researcher at VIT Vellore. I have recently submitted my thesis on Steganography Algorithms where I analysed and developed new steganography and watermarking schemes. My specialization is in the areas of Information Security (cryptography and steganography), Image Processing and Computer Vision. I am currently looking for jobs which need Research & Development (R&D) skills in the fields of Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI). 

What did I do during my PhD?
===
I analysed steganography algorithms, specifically Reversible Data Hiding (RDH) schemes and devised a new technique to hide secret data in image files. I will be putting up more details about my work in the blogs section of this website.

I also served as a Teaching/Research Assistant for 4 years where I assisted several faculties and students with their coursework and projects. I have provided the details of my responsibilities during this period [here](https://shounakshastri.github.io/teaching/).
