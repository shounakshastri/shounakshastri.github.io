About Me
===

I am a Researcher with a PhD in steganography algorithms from VIT, Vellore . My work revolves around Steganography Algorithms where I have analysed and developed new steganography and watermarking schemes. My specialization is in the areas of Information Security (cryptography and steganography), Image Processing and Computer Vision. I am currently looking for jobs which need Research & Development (R&D) skills in the fields of Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI). 

What did I do during my PhD?
===
I analysed steganography algorithms, specifically Reversible Data Hiding (RDH) schemes and devised a new technique to hide secret data in image files. You can read about some of my work [here](https://shounakshastri.github.io/publications/). For a complete list of my publications, you can check my [ORCID page](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2247-9046).

I also served as a Teaching/Research Assistant for 4 years where I assisted several faculties and students with their coursework and projects. The details of my responsibilities during this period can be found [here](https://shounakshastri.github.io/teaching/).
