About Me
===

I am a PhD Researcher at VIT Vellore. My work mostly revolved around analysing and developing new steganography and watermarking schemes. My specilization is in the areas of Information Security (cryptography and steganography), Image Processing and Computer Vision. I have submitted my thesis and am waiting for the reviewers to give their comments. I am currently looking for jobs which need Research & Development (R&D) skills in the fields of Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI). 

What did I do during my PhD?
===
I analysed steganography algorithms, specifically Reversible Data Hiding (RDH) schemes and devised a new technique to hide secret data in image files. I will be putting up more details about my work in the blogs section of this website.

I also served as a Teaching/Research Assistant for 4 years where I assisted several faculties and students with their coursework and projects. I have provided the details of my responsibilities during this period [hear](https://shounakshastri.github.io/teaching/). I managed to publish a few papers during my PhD. You can go through the list on my [ORCID page](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2247-9046).

What am I doing now?
=====

Well...
- Learning and relearning stuff related to ML and DL. (I will shortly have some projects up and running and I will put up the documentation here. Stay tuned.)

- Applying for jobs in R&D, preferably in the ML/DL/AI space. (No success yet. <sub>Remember the first ideal of the Knight Radients "journey before destination" 😥</sub>)

- Teaching myself to paint with watercolours. (No progress to show here either, I am terrible at this)

- Reading books (I have completed 24/20 books pledged for the Goodreads 2020 Reading Challenge. Thank you lockdown!).
