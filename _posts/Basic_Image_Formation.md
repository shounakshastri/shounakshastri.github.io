Introduction
---

This blog gives a basic summary of what one might need to start learning image processing. This post is intended for a reader who is just starting in image processing as a part of their curriculum or has a passing curiosity about cameras and imaging. I have summarized the following topics here:

1. Basic image formation
2. Pixles
3. Color Spaces
4. Histograms

Basic Image Formation
---

An image is formed when light bounces off a surface and falls on a sensor. The sensor might be analog as in the case of a film camera or the human eye, or digital as in mobile phone cameras. For our case, we will be primariy considering the digital sensor. The digital sensor samples the light falling on it and creates an image. 

Pixles
---

What does it mean when we say the "digital sensor samples the light"? Well the sensor takes in the light and divides it into pixles. Pixles are the basic elements which combine together to form an image, similar to what atoms do to form a water molecule or cells do to form a tree.
