The sharing of digital media over the Internet has given rise to many issues concerning security and privacy of data. While encryption is used to secure the data, the appearance of encrypted images and video streams makes them vulnerable to attacks. This situation can be disastrous in cases where security and privacy are of utmost importance, such as in military, medical, or covert applications. This drawback of cryptography is one of the many factors which encourage research in the field of information hiding. Information hiding aims to protect the integrity of the data during transmission or while in storage. Steganography is a branch of information hiding which conceals the existence of the secret data hidden in a cover medium. This publication discusses the idea behind information hiding with respect to reversible and non-reversible steganography. It starts with a general introduction about steganography and its classification into spatial and transform domain techniques, then moves on to give an explanation of the various spatial and transform domain techniques in use today. It then suggests the scope for future developments followed by the conclusion.

The paper was written under the guidance of Dr. Thanikaiselvan V who is a Professor in VIT Vellore and in collaboration with [Dr. Shaik Ahmad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-ahmad-shaik-phd-a3026a20/).
