Part of my job as a Teaching and Research Assistant was to help mentor and guide Bachelors and Masters degree students in completing their semseter and degree projects (and preferably help them get a publication in the process).

I have guided more than 30 students with their projects by

- Helping them find a problem statement.
- Helping them understand the tehnical literature.
- Helping them with the code.
- Keeping them on schedule so that they were able to present their project in front of the review panel.
- Helping the students with submissions to national conferences
